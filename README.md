this is just a basic overview of the project
there are boxes you can hold and move by holding the e key
you win by moving a box onto a button and placing a box in the path of a line trace
there is a collider and overlap event on the button
there are line traces on the player and the trip wire
and once both are done the walls around the player dissapear
